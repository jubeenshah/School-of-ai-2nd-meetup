    " - To create a moving window to average across the 4x4 image, we will use a built in function that will convolute a constant across a window of the shape 2x2. This function is quite common in image processing, and the function we would be using is `conv2d()`. This function would take a piecewise product of the window and a filter we specify. We must also specify a `stride` for moving the window in both the diractions. Here, we will compute four moving averages, top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right four pixels. we do this by creating a 2x2 window having a stride of length 2 in each directioon. to take the average, we will convolute the 2x2 window with a constant of 0.25"

    " - Let us now define a custom layer that will operate on the 2x2 output of the moving average window. The custom function will first multiply the input by another 2x2 matrix sensor, and them add one to each entry. After this, we take the sigmoid of each element and return the 2x2 matric. Since matrix multiplication only operates on two-dimensional matrices, we need to drop the extra dimension of our image that are of size 1. TensorFlow can do this with the built in function `tf.squeeze()`"
