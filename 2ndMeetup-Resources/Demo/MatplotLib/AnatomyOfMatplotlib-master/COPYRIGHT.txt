That said, I must acknowledge the sources of inspiration for this tutorial.
Much of the content comes from the matplotlib documentation, which is the
collaborative result of many hard-working people around the world. I also
took inspiration from Eric Jones' SciPy 2012 tutorial, as well as Nicolas
Rougier's beginner's guide.
