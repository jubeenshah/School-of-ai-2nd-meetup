Important Reminders About Matrix Multiplication
-----------------------------------------------

*   The **number** of **columns** in the **left** matrix **must equal** the **number** of **rows** in the **right** matrix.
*   The **answer** matrix **always has** the **same number** of **rows** as the **left** matrix and the **same number** of **columns** as the **right** matrix.
*   **Order matters**. Multiplying **A•B** is **not the same** as multiplying **B•A**.
*   Data in the **left** matrix **should be** arranged as **rows**., while data in the **right** matrix **should be** arranged as **columns**.

If you keep these four points in mind, you should always be able to figure out how to properly arrange your matrix multiplications when building a neural network.
