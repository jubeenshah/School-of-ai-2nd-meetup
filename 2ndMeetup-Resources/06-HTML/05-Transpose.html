<h1>Transpose</h1>

<p>Getting the transpose of a matrix is really easy in NumPy. Simply access its <code>T</code> attribute. There is also a <code>transpose()</code> function which returns the same thing, but you’ll rarely see that used anywhere because typing <code>T</code> is so much easier. :)</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>m = np.array([[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8], [9,10,11,12]])
m
# displays the following result:
# array([[ 1,  2,  3,  4],
#        [ 5,  6,  7,  8],
#        [ 9, 10, 11, 12]])

m.T
# displays the following result:
# array([[ 1,  5,  9],
#        [ 2,  6, 10],
#        [ 3,  7, 11],
#        [ 4,  8, 12]])
</code></pre>

<p>NumPy does this without actually moving any data in memory - it simply changes the way it indexes the original matrix - so it’s quite efficient.</p>

<p>However, that also means you need to be careful with how you modify objects, because <strong>they are sharing the same data</strong>. For example, with the same matrix <code>m</code> from above, let&#8217;s make a new variable <code>m_t</code> that stores <code>m</code>&#8217;s transpose. Then look what happens if we modify a value in <code>m_t</code>:</p>

<pre><code>m_t = m.T
m_t[3][1] = 200
m_t
# displays the following result:
# array([[ 1,   5, 9],
#        [ 2,   6, 10],
#        [ 3,   7, 11],
#        [ 4, 200, 12]])

m
# displays the following result:
# array([[ 1,  2,  3,   4],
#        [ 5,  6,  7, 200],
#        [ 9, 10, 11,  12]])
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how it modified both the transpose and the original matrix, too! That&#8217;s because they are sharing the same copy of data. So remember to consider the transpose just as a different view of your matrix, rather than a different matrix entirely.</p>

<h3>A real use case</h3>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to get into too many details about neural networks because you haven&#8217;t covered them yet, but there is one place you will almost certainly end up using a transpose, or at least thinking about it.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you have the following two matrices, called <code>inputs</code> and <code>weights</code>,</p>

<pre><code>inputs = np.array([[-0.27,  0.45,  0.64, 0.31]])
inputs
# displays the following result:
# array([[-0.27,  0.45,  0.64,  0.31]])

inputs.shape
# displays the following result:
# (1, 4)

weights = np.array([[0.02, 0.001, -0.03, 0.036], \
    [0.04, -0.003, 0.025, 0.009], [0.012, -0.045, 0.28, -0.067]])

weights
# displays the following result:
# array([[ 0.02 ,  0.001, -0.03 ,  0.036],
#        [ 0.04 , -0.003,  0.025,  0.009],
#        [ 0.012, -0.045,  0.28 , -0.067]])

weights.shape
# displays the following result:
# (3, 4)
</code></pre>

<p>I won&#8217;t go into what they&#8217;re for because you&#8217;ll learn about them later, but you&#8217;re going to end up wanting to find the <strong>matrix product</strong> of these two matrices.</p>

<p>If you try it like they are now, you get an error:</p>

<pre><code>np.matmul(inputs, weights)
# displays the following error:
# ValueError: shapes (1,4) and (3,4) not aligned: 4 (dim 1) != 3 (dim 0)
</code></pre>

<p>If you did the matrix multiplication lesson, then you&#8217;ve seen this error before. It&#8217;s complaining of incompatible shapes because the number of columns in the left matrix, <code>4</code>, does not equal the number of rows in the right matrix, <code>3</code>.</p>

<p>So that doesn&#8217;t work, but notice if you take the transpose of the <code>weights</code> matrix, it will:</p>

<pre><code>np.matmul(inputs, weights.T)
# displays the following result:
# array([[-0.01299,  0.00664,  0.13494]])
</code></pre>

<p>It also works if you take the transpose of <code>inputs</code> instead and swap their order, like we showed in the video:</p>

<pre><code>np.matmul(weights, inputs.T)
# displays the following result:
# array([[-0.01299],# 
#        [ 0.00664],
#        [ 0.13494]])
</code></pre>

<p>The two answers are transposes of each other, so which multiplication you use really just depends on the shape you want for the output.</p>
