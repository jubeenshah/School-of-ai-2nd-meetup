## What is [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/whatisnumpy.html)
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

## What is [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)

Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

Pandas is a NumFOCUS sponsored project. This will help ensure the success of development of pandas as a world-class open-source project, and makes it possible to donate to the project.

Read more about Pandas in the [documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org)

The goal of the following cookbook is to give you some concrete examples forgetting started with pandas. The [docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) are really comprehensive. However, I've often had people tell me that they have some trouble getting started, so these are
examples with real-world data, and all the bugs and weirdness
that that entails.

### How to use these notebooks

```
pip install ipython pandas numpy tornado pyzmq jinja2 matplotlib
```

Or better yet, while in conda environment use the `conda` command to install the dependencies.

Create a new environment 
```
conda create -name pandasEnv
conda activate pandasEnv
```
Or go to the console and select, open with terminal and run the following command.

```
conda install ipython pandas numpy tornado pyzmq jinja2 matplotlib python=2.7 notebook jupyter jupyterlab_launcher jupyterlab
```

## What is [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)

Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.

Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. You can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code. 

The following set of notebooks should help with learning matplotlib in more detail.

### [Example Notebooks](https://github.com/jubeenshah/School-of-ai-2nd-meetup/tree/master/2ndMeetup-Resources/Demo/TensorFlow)

* The first 3-4 notebooks would be aimed at giving you a taste of TensorFlow and how it can be used in real world application.
* The [source](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/) of the following notebooks gives a brief overview of the tensorflow libraries.
	* Please note that you do not have to know TensorFlow at all. Moreover, you're not expected to understand anything from the notebooks. It is there to just give you tase as to what can be done.
* The [first notebook](https://github.com/jubeenshah/School-of-ai-2nd-meetup/blob/master/2ndMeetup-Resources/Demo/TensorFlow/basic_classification.ipynb) is a basic Classification Notebook using the [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. 
	* 	[This guide](https://github.com/jubeenshah/School-of-ai-2nd-meetup/blob/master/2ndMeetup-Resources/Demo/TensorFlow/basic_classification.ipynb) trains a neural network model to classify images of clothing, like sneakers and shirts. It's okay if you don't understand all the details, this is a fast-paced overview of a complete TensorFlow program with the details explained as we go. The images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28 by 28 pixels), as seen here:
<table>
  <tr><td>
    <img src="https://tensorflow.org/images/fashion-mnist-sprite.png"
         alt="Fashion MNIST sprite"  width="600">
  </td></tr>
  <tr><td align="center">
    <b>Figure 1.</b> <a href="https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist">Fashion-MNIST samples</a> (by Zalando, MIT License).<br/>&nbsp;
  </td></tr>
</table>	



* The [second notebook](https://github.com/jubeenshah/School-of-ai-2nd-meetup/blob/master/2ndMeetup-Resources/Demo/TensorFlow/basic_text_classification.ipynb) is a text classification example that makes use of the reviews from [IMBD dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/imdb) as positive or negative. 
	* This notebook uses [tf.keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras), a high-level API to build and train models in TensorFlow. For a more advanced text classification tutorial using tf.keras, see the [MLCC Text Classification Guide](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/text-classification/).
* The [third notebook](https://github.com/jubeenshah/School-of-ai-2nd-meetup/blob/master/2ndMeetup-Resources/Demo/TensorFlow/basic_regression.ipynb) is regressions notebook for the [boston housing prices](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Edelve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html) dataset. 
	* This notebook builds a model to predict the median price of homes in a Boston suburb during the mid-1970s. To do this, we'll provide the model with some data points about the suburb, such as the crime rate and the local property tax rate.
* The [fourth notebook](https://github.com/jubeenshah/School-of-ai-2nd-meetup/blob/master/2ndMeetup-Resources/Demo/TensorFlow/overfit_and_underfit.ipynb) is focussed towards overfitting and underfitting data.
	* In this notebook, we'll explore two common regularization techniques—weight regularization and dropout—and use them to improve our IMDB movie review classification notebook.
