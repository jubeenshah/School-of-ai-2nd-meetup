# School-of-ai-2nd-meetup

Hello world, Here is the comprehensive list of all the inforamtion we discussed today in our meetup.

## What is [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/whatisnumpy.html)
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.
